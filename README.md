# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Big O Notation

- Used to analyze the performance of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends.
- The time or space complexity depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used.

## Arrays and Objects

- If being inserted or removed at the end, it is O(1)
- If the index/keys have to shift because of an insertion or removal, it is O(N)

## Problem Solving Approach

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor

## Problem Solving Patterns

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

## Recursions

- Recursion is a process (or function) that calls itself
- It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
- Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case

## Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search - Given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.
- Binary Search - Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Naive String Search - A straightforward approach involves checking pairs of characters individually
