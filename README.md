## Big O Notation

- Used to analyze the performance of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends.
- The time or space complexity depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used.
