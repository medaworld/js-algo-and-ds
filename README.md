# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Big O Notation

- Used to analyze the performance of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends.
- The time or space complexity depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used.

## Arrays and Objects

- If being inserted or removed at the end, it is O(1)
- If the index/keys have to shift because of an insertion or removal, it is O(N)

## Problem Solving Approach

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor
